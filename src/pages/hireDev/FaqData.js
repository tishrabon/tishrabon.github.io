    question: `Why hire someone from Bangladesh for a remote role?`,
    answer: `In an ecosystem with more limited factors, I’ve developed a level of quality, ambition, vision, and drive that’s rare. You’re getting someone with a rare mindset, vision, and resilience who stands out no matter where you're looking. Give me the opportunity to grow and go further, before someone else does, and I’ll show you why I’m worth the investment.`,

    question: `Is coding and problem-solving something you enjoy, or just a job to you?`,

    answer: `In my early university semesters, while most struggled with core programming in C, I found it exciting and intuitive. Once, I even scored the highest in a semester final without studying at all the night before. Currently focused on frontend development, I aim to become a full-stack developer and plan to revisit problem-solving once I land a job. In short, I love programming!`,

    question: `How do you handle constructive criticism on your work?`,

    answer: `If someone’s giving me constructive criticism, it means I either lack something or need to improve, right? So why wouldn’t I take advantage of it? It’s a win-win. I grow, and the company benefits.`,

    question: `If you could reshape one famous app or website, what would it be and why?`,

    answer: `I'd reshape YouTube. My feed is flooded with unwanted or least wanted content, with no way to block channels or effectively report ads, all in pursuit of revenue. This short-sighted approach erodes genuine brand loyalty (mine included) and frustrates users, leaving advertisers with an audience that's anything but ideal. All this stems from the lack of a real system for users to express their preferences, a system that YouTube simply ignores. I'd introduce robust feedback features to create a healthier balance among users, YouTube, and advertisers.`,

  {
    question: `What do you bring to the table that other developers don’t?`,

    answer: `I approach app development from multiple perspectives. I think about how users' needs evolve over time, what they want now, how they’ve changed, how they’ll change in the future, Whether it’s a long-term or short-term project, I might keep users' expectations low with high satisfaction, so that later I can drop an exclusive feature that will blow their minds. This kind of vision shapes both my design and programming work. I'm not just a programmer. I'm a package of solid coding skills and long-term vision with a strategic mindset`,

    question: `How do you deal with imposter syndrome, especially in a new role or when you're trying something challenging?`,

    answer: `I can dive into self-doubt without losing my focus. Even when imposter syndrome kicks in, my ability to analyze the situation from multiple angles keeps me calm. I break things down step by step, prioritize, and move forward without letting emotions take over.`,

    question: `How do you see the future of frontend development, and what role do you want to play in it?`,

    answer: `It's a crucial fact that AI will undeniably take over many programming jobs, but it won't replace all of us! Talented, dedicated, and skilled developers will always be in demand. My goal is to level up my programming skills to the top tier, ensuring that I remain indispensable in the age of AI. So, I either level up or look for another career path where AI isn't a threat!`,
