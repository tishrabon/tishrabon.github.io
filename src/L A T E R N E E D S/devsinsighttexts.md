Take a look at my portfolio, and you'll see the quality and uniqueness of my work. It reflects my personal taste and attention to detail. The portfolio features two themes: Terminal and Marshmallow. These aren’t just typical dark and light themes—they each have their own distinct character, patterns, and design philosophy, setting them apart from the traditional approach.

That's who I am.

`I'm fascinated by the history of human civilization, curious about what things were like then, what they are now, and the journey in between—how paradigms, thoughts, and tastes have evolved over time. This curiosity leads me to explore insights from Philosophy, Psychology, Religion, History, and Anthropology. I enjoy watching documentaries and listening to podcasts to explore different perspectives on these topics and gain a deeper visualization.`
